    "In terms of an example from the previous lectures, it was really eye-opening to use calender plots for week 2's temporal data. Ditching the bar charts and encoding the data in a format more tightly connected with time and dates allowed for new patterns to emerge that was otherwise hidden."

    "Pie charts are problematic because our brain is bad at estimating the exact size of areas and angles. This makes comparison between two data points difficult, which is a deal-braker for Data Scientists. Bar charts avoid this issue by encoding the data in lengths and positions, which is easier for the brain to handle.\n",

    "No, some encodings offer better solutions to specific things than others. For example visualizing sizes relative to each other can be clearly understood using a bar chart, while a pie chart does a terrible job of conveying the relativity among numbers, because it is difficult to read off angles for the human brain (comparison is tough).\n",

    "Pie-charts are bad because everything they can show can be better shown using a different type of chart. Pie charts are usually used to show a comparison of some sorts between multiple elements, however if these elements are somewhat similar then it becomes extremely hard to compare - then if that is the case why would you ever use a pie chart for comparison if you cannot successfully compare stuff - indeed that is the question ;)"
